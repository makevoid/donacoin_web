        %h2.muted Processing power to coins

        %p BitCoin, Litecoin and other electronic coins ( or crypto currencies, how do you want to call them :) ) rewards people that give theirs cpu. A person giving you money? No. The protocol! Why? To remain "alive" (working). Read more about this here: <DuckDuckGo Search: crypto currencies mining>


        %h2.muted Coins to Cause

        %p
        The Cause (ngo/project/association/team) will get money as a donation from us or from
        %a{ href: "/admin" } the admin
        managing the project


        %h2.muted Lower fees than Paypal!

        %p Paypal is the most used donation "system" in the world, we aim to change that, his current fee (2.2% + 0.30$) is related to Credit Card processing fee, we use e-coins, there is no such thing in a distributed system. We aim to reach the 2% fee

        %h2.muted Coins to Admins

        %p DonaCoin will be automatic some day, now it needs admins, admins are rewarded with some percentage (it should be lower than 2.9%, that is the standard credit-card transaction), becoming an
        %a{ href: "/admin" } admin
        is fairly simple, Read more about creating your DonaCoin cause and becoming an admin here:
        %a{ href: "/become_admin" } /Become_Admin

        %p Note: admins must be trusted people, you must know admins in real life, ideally any computer-nerd friend that you have can become an admin.
