      %p We are not liable to any damage made at the machines running the Donacoin software. We set a default mining value by the half of your machine physical cores or less. Be always aware of your CPU / GPU temperature, especially in summer! Keep your machines cooled well if you want to maximize donations, remember laptops are not always designed to be at full load / heat, we recommend not going over 70% of the speed with them.
      %p Always try to keep all your computer temperatures under 70Â° C. This is very recommended and will improve your system's life.
